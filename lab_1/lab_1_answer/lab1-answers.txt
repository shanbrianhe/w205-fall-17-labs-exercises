Ans: Personally I find it most useful when I have to perfrom data analyses on data-sets that are too large to be hosted on my local computer. A cloud infrastructure like AWS cuts out the 
     capital expenditure for essential hardwares, increases flexibility to work from anywhere, and also provides reliable backup and recovery solutions without a cost

Q3: What is the difference between spot instances and reserved instances?

Ans: Amazon Spot instances allow you to bid on spare EC2 computing capacity for a discount in price. The Spot instances are terminated when the bid price is lower than the real-time spot price
     Amazon Reserved instances require either 1 or 3 year commitment for capacity reservation. And the discount automatically applies when the on-demand instances are run with matching 
     attributes (instance type, scope, tenancy, platform). The suggested use cases for Spot and Reserved instances are different - SI is for applicationes with flexible start/end times and
     RI is for applications with steady state usage and customers that can commited to using EC2 over a 1 or 3 year term
