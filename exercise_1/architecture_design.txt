List of Tables:

hospitals:                source table based on Hospital General Information.csv
hospitals_t:              transformed table from source table hospitals
effective_care:           source table based on Timely and Effective Care - Hospital.csv
effective_care_t:         transformed table from source table effective_care
readmissions:             source table based on Readmissions and Deaths - Hospital.csv
readmissions_t:           transformed table from readmissions
measures:                 source table based on Measure Dates.csv
measures_t:               transformed table from source table measures
surveys_responses:        source table based on hvbp_hcahps_05_28_2015.csv
surveys_responses_t:      transformed table from surveys_responses
states:                   lookup table with state name and state abbreviation
tmp_measure_lkp:          table that houses measures that have at least 1,000 hospitals sampled and a flag labelling each measure
                          with either '+' implying the higher the better or '-' for the lower the better and 'NA' for measures that
                          aren't defined clearly to judge which is the correct direction
tmp_measure_score:        table that contains all the measure scores to be analyzed from effective_care_t and readmissions_t tables,
                          their averages, and standard deviation
hospital_compare_score:   table that contains all the measure scores for each provider and their standardized compare_score, to be used
                          in analyses

File/Folder Structure:

loading_and_modelling/    raw_data/:                    folder that contains raw hospital compare data
                          data_for_loading/:            prepared data files for loading
                          load_data_lake.sh:            bash file that prepares data files in local machine and load them into
