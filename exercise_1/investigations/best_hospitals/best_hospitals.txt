Procedures -

In order to compare hospitals and the scores of their different procedures/measures. I followed the steps below
1) Determine Scope of Measures
2) Standardize Scores of Measures
3) Compare Average Standardize Scores across Hospitals

Step 1:
        To determine the scope of measures, I first looked at the metadata for the measures (e.g. the footnote for
scores in the effective care table) and excluded data that have discrepancies. Then I looked at the amount of scores
taken for each measure - the majority of the measures were taken for at least 1,000 hospitals. I excluded
the ones that were taken for fewer than 1000 hospitals (out of 4730) to ensure adequate sample sizes for the measures
to be compared.

Step 2:
        To standardize the measure scores, I based my understanding of the measures on the following source:
https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/Data/Data-Updated.html. I noticed that some measure scores indicate better care quality
as they increase while some are the opposite. Hence, I created a lookup table which has the measure id, measure name and a new
field called measure flag. Measure flag was created to label each measure with either '+' implying the higher the better or '-'
the lower the better and 'NA' for measures that aren't defined clearly for me to judge which is the correct direction.
        I then created a temporary table to house all the applicable measures from the effective care and readmissions tables.
But since the scores came in with different scales and ranges, I used the following methodology to standardize them to enable
comparison across different measures. Assuming each measure has a normal distribution, I calculated the means and standard
deviations across all hospitals and computed their z values: (score - average score)/(sample standard deviation) when a measure
has a flag '+' or (average score - score)/(sample standard deviation) when a measure has a flag '-'.

        With their z values, I then assigned standardized compare_score to the measures as following:

         ---------------------------------------
               Z Range      |   compare_score
         ---------------------------------------
              Z < -2.0              1
          -2.0 <= Z < -1.5          2
          -1.5 <= Z < -1.0          3
          -1.0 <= Z < -0.5          4
          -0.5 <= Z < -0.0          5
           0.0 <= Z < 0.5           6
           0.5 <= Z < 1.0           7
           1.0 <= Z < 1.5           8
           1.5 <= Z < 2.0           9
              Z >= 2.0              10

        The standardized measure scores, centered at around 5.5, allow us to fairly compare and combine different measure scores.

Step 3:
        To find out the hospitals that are models of high-quality care, I made an assumption that the hospitals need to have
at least 21 measures (out of 41 applicable measures, ~50%) recorded so that the we are looking at hospitals that have consistent
high-quality care for a variety of procedures.
        With that in mind, I came up with the list above ranking the top 10 hospitals with the highest average standardized measure
scores across at least 21 applicable measures.
