Investigation 4: Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

Results -

Case 1: With all procedures considered (timely and effective care + readmissions):

        For average scores, they are positively correlated (correlation coefficient = 0.30) to the scores
        in the patients survey responses

        For procedural variability, they are negatively correlated (correlation coefficient = -0.23) to
        the scores in the patients survey responses

Case 2: With only hospital timely and effective care procedures considered:

        For average scores, they are positively correlated (correlation coefficient = 0.24) to the scores
        in the patients survey responses (less correlated than case 1)

        For procedural variability, they are negatively correlated (correlation coefficient = -0.14) to
        the scores in the patients survey responses. (less correlated than case 1)

Case 3: With only readmission and mortality rates considered:

        For average scores, they are positively correlated (correlation coefficient = 0.23) to the scores
        in the patients survey responses (less correlated than case 1)

        For procedural variability, they are negatively correlated (correlation coefficient = -0.29) to
        the scores in the patients survey responses. (more correlated than case 1)

Procedures -

        Referring to http://www.hcahpsonline.org/files/HCAHPS%20Fact%20Sheet%20May%202012.pdf, the effective measure
of the rating for each hospital is the sum of hcahps_base_score (out of 80) and hcahps_consistency_score (out of 20).

        I then calculated the correlation coefficients between 1) the average compare_scores and hcahps total score
(hcahps_base_score + hcahps_consistency_score) and 2) the standard deviation of compare_scores and hcahps total score,
using the formula corr(X, Y) = [E(XY)-E(X)*E(Y)] / [STDDEV(X) * STDDEV(Y)].

        I did the analyses for three different scenarios: 1) with all procedures (timely & effective care + readmission)
considered, 2) with only timely & effective care procedures considered and 3) with only readmission procedure considered.
So that we can further exploit how different types of procedures correlate to patients' feedback.

Conclusions -

        For all scenarios, I see positive correlations between the average scores and patients' ratings and
negative correlations between the procedural variability and patients' ratings, which is expected. Furthermore, the positive
correlation for average score is the highest with all procedures combined while the variability of readmission procedures
has the strongest negative correlation with patients' feedback.
