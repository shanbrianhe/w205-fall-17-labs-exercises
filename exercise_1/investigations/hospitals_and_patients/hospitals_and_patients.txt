Investigation 4: Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

Results -

        For average scores, they are slightly (correlation coefficient = 0.30) positively correlated to the scores
        in the patients survey responses

        For procedural variability, they are slightly (correlation coefficient = -0.23) negatively correlated to
        the scores in the patients survey responses

Procedures -

        Referring to http://www.hcahpsonline.org/files/HCAHPS%20Fact%20Sheet%20May%202012.pdf, the effective measure
of the rating for each hospital is the sum of hcahps_base_score (out of 80) and hcahps_consistency_score (out of 20).
        I then calculated the correlation coefficients between 1) the average compare_scores and hcahps total score
(hcahps_base_score + hcahps_consistency_score) and 2) the standard deviation of compare_scores and hcahps total score,
using the formula corr(X, Y) = [E(XY)-E(X)*E(Y)] / [STDDEV(X) * STDDEV(Y)].
