1. List the execution time of the weblog aggregation query for Hive, SparkSQL, and SparkSQL on Parquet.
    Hive:                 50.742 sec
    SparkSQL:             9.424 sec
    SparkSQL on Parquet:  2.882 sec

2. How many jobs does Hive launch? Does SparkSQL launch jobs?
    Hive:     2 jobs
    SparkSQL: None

3. Write a query which joins weblogs_parquet to user_info and counts the top 5 locations. List the locations.
    spark-sql> SELECT user_info.location, count(user_info.location) as location_count
         > FROM weblogs_parquet, user_info
         > WHERE weblogs_parquet.user_id = user_info.user_id
         > GROUP BY user_info.location
         > ORDER BY location_count DESC
         > LIMIT 5;
